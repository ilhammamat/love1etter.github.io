    <h2>About me ;)</h2>
    <p>I am a 17 year old male music producer. I enjoy cooking, hanging out with my family, and learning about cybersecurity and programming. At the age of 11 I was diagnosed with Autism. I struggle with communication and other social skills but that doesn't change who I am as a person. I've made many great friends throughout my life as well as lost many. I try my best to help others and make them happy. If you ever want to talk, I'm willing to listen... My discord is: Elemental™#1107</p>
